# Donation Miner

Note: this module has been deprecated, despite many users it created virtually zero income.

## About

This module allows you to donate CPU time to thirty bees by mining cryptocurrency. This module does not affect the front end of your store or your users. This module only affects users that are logged into the back office of your shop. 

## Contributing

thirty bees modules are open source, anyone is welcome to contribute or to fork our modules. 

### Purpose of this module

Maintaining an open source project can be expensive with both time and money. This module aims to offset that expense. Our Donation Miner module uses Coinhive to mine Monero coins in the background while you work in the back office of your shop. Using this module is 100% optional. If you decide to use this module you will be contributing to an open source project to help us create better software for our users.
